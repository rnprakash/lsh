Consider $n$ streams of time series describing the utilization traces of $n$ resources, each at some (fixed) granularity.
Denote the space of a time series as $S$.

Define a function $d$:

\begin{align*}
    d_{a,b} \colon S^2 &\to [0,1]\\
    (x[a:b],y[a:b]) &\mapsto [0,1] \numberthis
\end{align*}

where $d$ maps a portion of two time series to a real number in $[0,1]$ that represents the distance between the partial time series.

Additionally, we require $d$ to be a metric (and satisfy the triangle inequality):

\begin{align*}
    d(x,y) = 0 \Leftrightarrow x = y \\
    d(x,y) = d(y,x) \ge 0 \\
    d(x,y) \le d(x,z) + d(z,y) \numberthis
\end{align*}

Out of the box Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) does not satisfy the triangle inequality, so it cannot be used.
We may attempt to leverage an approximate lower-bound DTW~\cite{Lemire09-DTW} as well as other metrics proposed in recent literature.

Fix $p_1, p_2 \in [0,1]$ with $p_1 \ge p_2$.
Then, we require that for a hash function $h \in \mathcal{H}, \Pr[h(x) = h(y)] \ge p_1 \forall~x,y \in S$ with $d(x,y) \le r$ for some fixed $r$.
Additionally, for $x,y \in S$ with $d(x,y) > r, \Pr[h(x) = h(y)] \le p_2$ for the same, fixed $r$.
This intuitively allows for hashes to ``collide'' with probability $p_1$ when time series are $r$-similar.
Further, the probability of incorrect collision is limited by $p_2$ (ideally close to $0$) when two time series are more than $r$ apart.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Use hash that approximates time series distance~\cite{Hachiya13-NSH,Kale14-KLSH}.
    \item Compose multiple kernels or hash families to obtain ranked ``normality'' metric to be used in classification or normality (anomaly) detection~\cite{Kim16-SLSH}.
    \item Perform continuous hashing on rolling windows of execution across channels of multiple resources to classify activity in real-time.
\end{itemize}
